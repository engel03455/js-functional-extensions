# js-functional-extensions

A library for JavaScript that adds more functional features to existing structures through property definition, allowing for a more seamless experience.

A powerful suite of extensions to existing structures and all-new structures designed to help you write functional code with ease.
This library includes useful extensions on some already existing structures:

  * `Object`
  * `Object.prototype`
  * `Array`
  * `Array.prototype`

It also has some new structures:

  * `Option` Monad, with extension methods on `Option`

This library is great for anyone who wants to try out functional programming or for those familiar with it who doesn't want to have to recreate the features they love to use.

Compatible with ES5 and designed with it in mind.
